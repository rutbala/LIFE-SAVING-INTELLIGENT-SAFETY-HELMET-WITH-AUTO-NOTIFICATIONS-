# LIFE-SAVING-INTELLIGENT-SAFETY-HELMET-WITH-AUTO-NOTIFICATIONS | Audino, Embedded C, Global System for Mobile Com., IoT

Introduction:-


Our proposed system integrates advanced safety features for two-wheeler drivers using hardware-centric technologies. It includes a smart ignition switch that mandates helmet detection via sensors before starting the bike. The system also features an alcohol detection module that prevents ignition if alcohol is detected, enhancing rider safety. A fall detection sensor differentiates between minor and major accidents, utilizing accelerometers and gyroscopes for precise impact assessment. In minor cases, an emergency override switch halts auto-notifications, while for major accidents, an auto-notification system sends alerts to emergency services, family members, and nearby users via GPS and GSM modules. Additionally, an audible alert system facilitates immediate local assistance, improving the chances of quick rescue.
